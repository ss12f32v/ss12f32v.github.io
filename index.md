## About Me

I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at the National Taiwan University working with [Prof. Yi-Hsuan Yang](https://affige.github.io/) and [Prof. Jyh-Shing Roger Jang](http://mirlab.org/jang/) at the Music and AI Lab. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from National Cheng Kung University.

My research interests focus on guitar-oriented music information retrieval, including transformations between different representation formats of guitar music. Recently, I have been concentrating on creative guitar amplifier tone modeling. I am also an intermediate electric guitar player, and I enjoy listening to anime, J-POP, and hard rock music.

If you need to contact me for any reason, you can reach me via email, and collaboration is welcomed. 

## Research Interests
